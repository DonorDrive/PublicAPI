# extra-life-api
A node-based API module that wraps the Extra-Life API, and extends it to provide additional info!

Why?
------
[I've been doing Extra Life for 3 years now](http://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=donorDrive.participant&participantID=219449), and every year I've built a custom little website to send to family, friends, and coworkers to help collect donations.

Up 'til last year, Extra Life had no public API to grab data about your team's donations, goals, info, etc.  So the old version of this used to scrape various Extra Life profile page to return data so people could build cool little site or stream overlays to adverise their campaign more effectively!

However, Extra Life has now released a public api that can be exposed for most any page by adding `&format=json` to the end of the profile's URL.  This is great, but I still found it lacking in a couple areas, so I decided to build something that expands on it a bit, while also making it an easy to use node module for easy consumption.

Installation
------
You can manually install this by cloning this github repo
```bash
https://github.com/ammuench/extra-life-api.git
```
or running

```bash
npm i extra-life-api
```

Once installed, you can require the package like any other standard node-module
```javascript
const elAPI = require('extra-life-api');
```

and then use it in your app as needed:
```javascript
elApi.getUserInfo(userId).then((data) => {
    console.log(data);
});
```

or ES6:
```javascript
elApi.getUserInfo(userId).then((data) => {
    console.log(data);
});
```

API Options
------
There are 4 methods which can be accessed from the module.  Each method must be passed the individual's 'Participant ID' or a team's 'Team ID'.  These can be found by going to your personal profile page or team profile page, and checking the end of the URL:

**Participant ID**

extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=donordrive.participant&participantID=**[PARTICIPANT ID HERE]**

**Team ID**

extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=donorDrive.team&teamID=**[TEAM ID HERE]**


* **extralifeapi.getUserInfo( participantId )**
  * Takes participantId as a parameter
  * Has a promise that contains basic user info & their current goal info passed as the following object:  
    
  **Example**
    ```javascript
      const extraLifeApi = require('extra-life-api');
      extraLifeApi.getUserInfo(participantId).then(data => {
        console.log(data);
      });
    ```

  **Returned object**

    }
    ```
    
* **extralifeapi.getRecentDonations( participantId )**
  * Takes participantId as a parameter
  * Returns a promise that contains an object which contains an array of donation objects in the following format:
  
  **Example**

      extraLifeApi.getRecentDonations(participantId).then(data => {
        console.log(data);
      });
    ```

  **Returned object**

    [{
      message: "Great job raising money!",
      createdOn: "2016-09-18T10:50:21-0400",

    }]
    ```
    
* **extralifeapi.getTeamInfo( teamId )**
  * Takes teamId as a parameter
  * Returns a promise that contains an object with the following info about a team, it's goals, and it's roster
    * *Roster only shows team members listed on first page at the moment*
