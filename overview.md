# Overview

## Versioning

The DonorDrive Public API will receive updates as the needs within the platform grow, and to accommodate feature requests from the community.

Our versioning strategy is as follows:

- Version formatting will follow a Major.Minor format (ex: Version `1.0`)
- New Minor Versions will be backward compatible with previous Minor Versions within the same Major Version (ex: Version `1.1` will be backwards compatible with Version `1.0`)
	- New Minor Version features will be noted in the appropriate resource documentation
- Major Versions may introduce breaking changes that are not backward compatible with previous Major Versions

**We will support previous Major Versions as long as reasonably possible, and do our best to notify the community well in advance of dropping support for a given Major Version.**
